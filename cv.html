        <h1>Suvi's CV</h1>

        <p>This page introduces you to my work-related background.</p>

        <h2>Summary of my work XP</h2>
        <p>After graduating, I began working in Tallink Silja Oy's Group and Conference Sales
            department.

            I worked at this company for nearly 12 years,
            during which I embraced the chance to explore various roles, until I decided to transition to my current
            studies in Business IT.

        <p>During my younger years, I gained hands-on experience in versatile outdoor jobs, such as ride
            operator (Linnanm채ki &amp; Disneyland), ice cream vendor, farm hand and
            children's 4H club leader.</p>


        I have learned that I thrive most when I'm in front of a keyboard.

        <h3>2008</h3>
        <p>Graduate | M채nts채l채 Upper Secondary School</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>My openness to continuous learning in life has enriched my professional skill set. In this
            section, I will list my current core competencies briefly.</p>

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>
            With extensive experience in <span class="highlight">CX design in B2B sales,
                implementing information systems,
                training employees, proofreading texts</span> and <span class="highlight">working as a sales
                team's support</span>, I see myself as a versatile generalist.</p>

        <p>I further
            enhanced my
            interpersonal skills in my most recent position, where I led a team of 13
            talented B2B sales and travel
            consultants, applying a coach-style leadership approach.</p>

        <p>My colleagues have described me as patient, approachable, and a supportive "therapist," always ready to
            listen,
            solve problems, and help them achieve their goals. </p>

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I am comfortable with using <span class="highlight">Finnish</span> and <span class="highlight">English</span>
            at work. I am able to communicate at an intermediate level in French and Swedish, and I am continuing to
            build my confidence. Learning new languages is one of my favourite hobbies!</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>I have used the following software in professional or academic settings: <span class="highlight">SeaWare,
                o365 (Word,
                PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook,
                Forms etc.), Visual Studio Code, Teams, Zoom,
                Liferay, SWTouch,
                Webfocus, Tamigo, Giosg
                chat, Sinch, Mepco, Klarna-online,
                Dibs, Basware, JIRA Service Desk, Kanban, Copilot,</span> and <span
                class="highlight">FastStoneCapture</span>.</p>
        <p>I have used MS Office programs on a daily basis since the early 2000's.
            Designing beautiful PowerPoint slides feels like creating a work of art to me - I could spend hours
            perfecting them!
        </p>
        <p>During my current studies, I will be introduced to additional business-related software, which I will update
            here as the courses progress.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>

        <p>In addition to creating and updating this webpage, I have experience in front-end coding using <span
                class="highlight">HTML</span>.
            While coding, I have also created website content and instructions for the sales personnel, travel
            agents, and external customers in Finnish and English. I began studying the basics of CSS and JavaScript in
            January 2025. It has
            been fascinating to explore how our
            digital world is built!</p>

        <h2>Future plans</h2>

        <p>Upon completing my current studies, I aim to secure a tech job in the Helsinki Metropolitan area. My ideal
            employer
            would align with my professional values:
            prioritizing the wellbeing of employees and customers, sustainable development and continuous growth through
            modern technologies.

            I am looking forward to collaborate with my awesome future colleagues.</p>
