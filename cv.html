        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
        <p>My current core competencies are <span class="highlight">hospitality
                management, employee training, proofreading, sales support, teamwork</span> and <span
                class="highlight">customer
                experience development</span>. I have
            been described as a very patient and
            helpful
            colleague. I further enhanced my interpersonal skills in my most recent position, where I led a team of 13
            talented B2B sales and travel
            specialists. I enjoy helping my
            team members solve problems and reach their goals.</p>

        <h3>Languages</h3>
        <p>I am comfortable with using <span class="highlight">Finnish</span> and <span class="highlight">English</span>
            at work. I am able to communicate at an intermediate level in French and Swedish, and I am continuing to
            build my confidence. Learning new languages is one of my favourite hobbies.</p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>I have used the following software in professional or academic settings: <span class="highlight">SeaWare,
                Office 365 (Word,
                PowerPoint, Excel, Outlook,
                Forms etc.), Visual Studio Code, Teams, Zoom,
                Liferay, SWTouch,
                Webfocus, Tamigo, Giosg
                chat, Sinch, Mepco, Klarna-online,
                Dibs, Basware, JIRA Service Desk, Kanban, Copilot,</span> and <span
                class="highlight">FastStoneCapture</span>.</p>
        <p>I am proficient with Windows 11 and have used MS Office programs on a daily basis since the early 2000's.
            Designing beautiful PowerPoint slides feels like creating a work of art to me - I could spend hours
            perfecting them.
        </p>
        <p>During my current studies, I will be introduced to additional business-related software, which I will update
            here as the courses progress.</p>

        <h3>Coding</h3>

        <p>In addition to this webpage, I have experience in front-end coding using <span class="highlight">HTML</span>.
            While coding, I also created content such as booking instructions for the sales personnel, travel
            agents, and external customers. I began studying the basics of CSS and JavaScript in January 2025. It has
            been fascinating to explore how our
            digital world is built.</p>

        <h2>Future plans</h2>

        <p>By the end of my studies I plan to secure a tech job in the Helsinki Metropolitan area.</p><br><br><br>
